# Snake-Game

## How the Game Works

### Objective
The objective of the game is to control a snake on a grid and eat food items to grow in length. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game screen.

### Setup
- The game screen is a square grid with dimensions of 600x600 pixels.
- The snake starts in the center of the grid, facing a default direction (typically right).
- Food items appear randomly on the grid for the snake to eat.

### Gameplay Mechanics
1. **Snake Movement:**
   - The snake moves continuously in the direction it was last directed by the player (using arrow keys).
   - Arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) control the direction of the snake's movement.
   - The snake wraps around the screen edges, meaning if it moves off one edge, it appears on the opposite edge of the screen (like in classic snake games).

2. **Eating Food:**
   - Food items appear randomly on the grid as small circles.
   - When the snakeâ€™s head (the front segment) collides with a food item, it consumes the food.
   - Upon eating food, the snake grows longer by adding a new segment to its tail.

3. **Growing and Scoring:**
   - Each time the snake eats food, the player's score increases.
   - The game speed may increase as the snake grows longer or based on game settings.

4. **Game Over Conditions:**
   - The game ends if the snake collides with itself (when its head intersects with any part of its body).
   - The game also ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries (if not set to wrap around).

### Features
- **Color Scheme:** 
  - The snake's is light yellow in colour.
  - Food items are represented by dark blue circles.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Players control the snake's movement using arrow keys.
  - The game responds in real-time to player input, updating the snake's position and checking for collisions.

### Future Improvements
- Additional features could include:
  - Increasing game difficulty over time.
  - Adding obstacles or hazards on the grid.
  - Implementing levels with different challenges or objectives.
